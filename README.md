# 🎬 MovieStreamingDB - SQL Query Practice

This repository contains SQL query practice based on a **Movie Streaming Platform** database (like Netflix). The goal is to apply basic SQL concepts to extract and analyze meaningful data from multiple tables.

---

## 📄 File

- `MovieStreaming_Queries.sql`: SQL file with queries demonstrating data extraction using `SELECT`, filters (`WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`), sorting (`ORDER BY`), and joins.

---

## 🔍 SQL Concepts Covered

- `SELECT *` and specific columns
- `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN` filters
- `ORDER BY` for sorting results
- `JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables

---

## 🧪 Sample Queries

Here are the key queries included in the file:

- ✅ Get all users and their subscription plans  
- ✅ List all movies with their genres  
- ✅ Display all movie reviews with ratings and comments  
- ✅ Filter movies with a 5-star rating  
- ✅ Show watch history of all users  
- ✅ Find movies released after 2020  
- ✅ Movies with duration **between** 90 and 150 minutes  
- ✅ Subscriptions with `PlanName` like "Premium%" and price > 500  
- ✅ Reviews with comments containing **"Fantastic"** or **"Emotional"**

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.sql` file in SSMS  
2. Ensure the database `MovieStreamingDB` is already created  
3. Run each query to view results from different tables  

---

## 📌 Purpose

This project is part of SQL learning focused on **data retrieval and filtering techniques**. It helps understand how real-world platforms like Netflix store and manage data in a relational database.

---

## 🧑‍🎓 Ideal For

- Beginners and freshers learning SQL  
- Students building projects using SSMS  
- Anyone interested in exploring SQL with a practical use case
